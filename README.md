# Exhume this plot
Assist in retrieving data value from an image of a graph.

## How to use the script
1. Download the `etp.py` Python script.
2. This script uses `pygame` and `numpy`, so make sure these packages are installed:
   - In your terminal, run `pip3 install numpy pygame`.
3. Launch the script with `.\etp.py myImagePath` by replacing `myImagePath` by the path of your graph image. Multiple images can be passed and analyzed successively with `.\etp.py myImage1Path myImage2Path`.

Alternatively, the images can just be drag-and-dropped onto the script file.
